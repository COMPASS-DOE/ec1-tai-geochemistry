Create Function to download data from google drive

```{r Make Functions}
## Create a function to read in data
read_data <- function(data){
  # read in data
  read_csv(file = data) %>%
  mutate(transect_location = stringr::str_replace(transect_location,"upland","Upland"))  %>%
  mutate(transect_location = stringr::str_replace(transect_location,"transition","Transition"))  %>% 
  mutate(transect_location = stringr::str_replace(transect_location,"wetland","Wetland")) %>%
  mutate(transect_location = stringr::str_replace(transect_location,"sediment","Sediment")) %>%  
}

```
## Get Data from GDrive

We need to import data from Google Drive folder.
The list is:
1. TC/TN
2. Bulk Density 
3. GWC
4. LOI
5. pH (soil)


```{r get data}

require(pacman)
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, # keep things tidy
               janitor, # useful for simplifying column names
               googlesheets4, # read_sheet 
               googledrive,# drive_ functions
               readr,# read in file types
               readxl) # read in excel files

## Set GDrive URL raw data files
directory = "https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1r3sP7tvhG2btZACvxZUdtrtSiLVGUUGp"

## Create a list of files to download
files <- drive_ls(directory) %>% 
  filter(grepl("_Soil_", name))

## Download files to local (don't worry, we'll delete em in a sec)
lapply(files$name, drive_download, overwrite = TRUE)

## Read in datasets
soils_data_all <- files$name %>% 
  map(read_data) %>% 
  reduce(full_join, by= c("campaign", "kit_id", "transect_location")) %>%
  bind_cols()

## Clean up local (delete downloaded files)
file.remove(c(files$name))

# Save as rds
saveRDS(soils_data_all, "./soils_data_merged.rds")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
