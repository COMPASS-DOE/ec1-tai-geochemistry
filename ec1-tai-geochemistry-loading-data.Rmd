Create Function to download data from google drive

```{r Make Functions}
## Create a function to read in data
read_data <- function(data){
  # read in data
  read_csv(file = data) %>%
  mutate(transect_location = stringr::str_replace(transect_location,"upland","Upland"))  %>%
  mutate(transect_location = stringr::str_replace(transect_location,"transition","Transition"))  %>% 
  mutate(transect_location = stringr::str_replace(transect_location,"wetland","Wetland")) %>%
  mutate(transect_location = stringr::str_replace(transect_location,"sediment","Sediment"))  
}

```
## Get Data from GDrive

We need to import data from Google Drive folder.
The list is:
1. TC/TN
2. Bulk Density 
3. GWC
4. LOI
5. pH (soil)


```{r get data}

require(pacman)
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, # keep things tidy
               janitor, # useful for simplifying column names
               googlesheets4, # read_sheet 
               googledrive,# drive_ functions
               readr,# read in file types
               readxl) # read in excel files

## Set GDrive URL raw data files
directory = "https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1r3sP7tvhG2btZACvxZUdtrtSiLVGUUGp"
KitMetadata = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eXPh-873xVYcREOAsbZu3pEgU4k9ykf-/view"

## Create a list of files to download
files <- drive_ls(directory) %>% 
  filter(grepl("_Soil_", name))

## Download files to local (don't worry, we'll delete em in a sec)
lapply(files$name, drive_download, overwrite = TRUE)

## Read in datasets
soils_data_all <- files$name %>% 
  map(read_data) %>% 
  reduce(full_join, by= c("campaign", "kit_id", "transect_location")) %>%
  bind_cols()

#Metadata 
KitMD = googledrive::drive_download(KitMetadata, overwrite = TRUE)
meta = read_csv(file = KitMD$name)

## Clean up local (delete downloaded files)
file.remove(KitMD$name)
file.remove(c(files$name))

#read in additional metadata from Donnie (need to get more details from him)
Donnie_soils_type <- read_csv("data/220713_soil_types_from_donnie.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

```

##Clean soils metadata
Do we know why there are NAs in these metrics for certain kits?
e.g. K012 Transition, Upland, K026 etc 

```{r soil metadata, echo=FALSE}
collection_metadata_soiltypes_raw_1 <-  Donnie_soils_type %>%
   pivot_longer(cols = c(wetland_soil_horizon, transition_soil_horizon, upland_soil_horizon),
               names_to = 'transect_location') %>% 
  select(kit_id, transect_location, value) %>%
  rename(soil_horizon = value) %>%
  mutate(transect_location = stringr::str_replace(transect_location,"_soil_horizon", "")) %>%
    mutate(transect_location = stringr::str_replace(transect_location,"upland","Upland"))  %>%
    mutate(transect_location = stringr::str_replace(transect_location,"transition","Transition"))  %>% 
    mutate(transect_location = stringr::str_replace(transect_location,"wetland","Wetland"))  

collection_metadata_soiltypes_raw_2 <-  Donnie_soils_type %>%
   pivot_longer(cols = c(`wt_Percent clay`, `tr_Percent clay`, `up_Percent clay`),
               names_to = 'transect_location') %>% 
  select(kit_id, transect_location, value) %>%
  rename(percent_clay = value) %>%
  mutate(transect_location = stringr::str_replace(transect_location,"_Percent clay", "")) %>%
    mutate(transect_location = stringr::str_replace(transect_location,"up","Upland"))  %>%
    mutate(transect_location = stringr::str_replace(transect_location,"tr","Transition"))  %>% 
    mutate(transect_location = stringr::str_replace(transect_location,"wt","Wetland"))  

collection_metadata_soiltypes_raw_3 <-  Donnie_soils_type %>%
   pivot_longer(cols = c(`wt_Percent sand`, `tr_Percent sand`, `up_Percent sand`),
               names_to = 'transect_location') %>% 
  select(kit_id, transect_location, value) %>%
  rename(percent_sand = value) %>%
  mutate(transect_location = stringr::str_replace(transect_location,"_Percent sand", "")) %>%
    mutate(transect_location = stringr::str_replace(transect_location,"up","Upland"))  %>%
    mutate(transect_location = stringr::str_replace(transect_location,"tr","Transition"))  %>% 
    mutate(transect_location = stringr::str_replace(transect_location,"wt","Wetland"))  

collection_metadata_soiltypes_a <- full_join(collection_metadata_soiltypes_raw_1, collection_metadata_soiltypes_raw_2, by=c("kit_id","transect_location"))

collection_metadata_soiltypes <- full_join(collection_metadata_soiltypes_a, collection_metadata_soiltypes_raw_3, by=c("kit_id","transect_location"))

collection_metadata_soiltypes <- collection_metadata_soiltypes %>%
 mutate(campaign= "EC1") 

```


               
##Merge and save
```{r merge and save, echo=FALSE}
soils_data_all_wmeta_a <- full_join(soils_data_all, meta, by="kit_id")

soils_data_all_wmeta <- full_join(soils_data_all_wmeta_a, collection_metadata_soiltypes, by=c("kit_id","transect_location","campaign"))

#something weird happening with kit 057
soils_data_all_wmeta <- soils_data_all_wmeta %>% 
  mutate(campaign = replace_na(campaign, "EC1"))
  
# Save as rds
saveRDS(soils_data_all, "./soils_data_merged.rds")
saveRDS(soils_data_all_wmeta, "./soils_data_merged_withmeta.rds")
```
